got let's call it a 'alpha' version working, pairing with LL.  reminded me of secret that is needed in .env file.  will have to remember to set this on the DB and Heroku configs when I go live.  need to streamline the routes i have and also maybe need some 'developer only' routes, like get all users and delete all users.  good first step.
